# What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
#In these projects, we were assessing what data structure would be the best for ABCU's staff to use when referencing courses in computer science.

# How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
#I not only analyzed what data structure would use the least memory, but I considered how much data was being sorted. Since it was a fairly static list, I chose to use vectors. Understanding the data structure is important because it can significantly impact the performance of the software you are creating. 

# How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
#Understanding the program from a pseudocode standpoint was hard to me. It was much easier when I was building the structure in the software. When I started building my software, I realized that I was missing some logic. I was able to add that logic and get a fully working program. 

# How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
#Working on this project helped me better understand data structures which can be vital to the success of software. 

# How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
#I believe that this project helped me develop skills that can be transferred to other projects in the future. I believe that it helped me understand how a program can be successfully maintained long-term.
